# Medieval Economic Explainer

Explain modern economic concepts through medieval trade examples and feudal systems—making economics accessible by connecting to historical precedents (inspired by Terry Jones's approach to making complex subjects engaging).

---

## Constraints
**You MUST refuse to apply this skill when:**
- Medieval examples would oversimplify crucial modern differences
- Historical analogy would spread economic misinformation
- Comparison would romanticize exploitative historical systems
- Modern examples would be clearer than historical ones

**Ethical boundaries:**
- Accuracy in both historical and economic facts
- Acknowledge differences between eras
- Don't romanticize feudal exploitation
- Use history to illuminate, not confuse

---

## When to Use

Use this skill when you detect:

- **Economic concepts** - Financial systems, trade mechanisms, market dynamics
- **Abstract financial ideas** - Terms that benefit from historical grounding
- **Modern innovations claiming novelty** - "Revolutionary" systems with medieval precedents
- **User confusion** - Economic topics needing more accessible explanation

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| input_data | Yes | The primary data or content to analyze |
| context | No | Additional background or constraints (default: none) |
| output_format | No | Preferred format for results (default: structured markdown) |

## Workflow
### Step 1: 1. Identify the Economic Concept
- What modern system/concept needs explaining?
- What are the core mechanics?
- What historical parallel exists?

### Step 2: 2. Find Medieval Equivalent
**Common parallels:**
- Guilds ↔ Unions/professional associations
- Bills of exchange ↔ Wire transfers
- Feudal obligations ↔ Employment contracts
- Manor economy ↔ Company towns
- Usury prohibitions ↔ Interest rate regulations
- Fair trade ↔ Medieval market regulations

### Step 3: 3. Explain Through Historical Example
- Present medieval system with specific details
- Show how it worked in practice
- Connect to modern equivalent
- Acknowledge differences

### Step 4: 4. Add Contemporary Relevance
- What does historical perspective reveal about modern system?
- What have we lost or gained?
- What patterns persist across time?

---

## Outputs

Economic explanations that:
- Use accurate medieval economic history
- Connect historical systems to modern equivalents
- Make abstract concepts concrete through historical examples
- Acknowledge both similarities and differences
- Reveal patterns in economic behavior across time

- Iterate on outputs if initial results don't fully meet requirements

**Common variations:**
- Adjust the depth of analysis based on available time and information
- Scale the approach for different levels of complexity
- Adapt the output format to audience needs

**When to skip this skill:**
- The situation doesn't match the core use cases
- Simpler approaches would be more appropriate
- Time constraints require faster methods

## Integration

This skill is part of a broader analytical framework. Use it when you need systematic analysis following this specific methodology.

**Works well with:**
- Other analytical skills for comprehensive evaluation
- Creative skills when generating solutions based on insights
- Strategic planning skills when acting on recommendations

**When to prefer this over alternatives:**
- The situation matches this skill's specific use cases
- You need the particular perspective this framework provides
- Other approaches haven't yielded satisfactory results

**Integration with expert personas:**
- This skill can be invoked as part of a larger analysis workflow
- Combine with domain-specific expertise for deeper insights
- Use iteratively for complex, multi-faceted problems

## Example

"Cryptocurrency and blockchain claim to be revolutionary, but Italian medieval bankers (1200-1500) invented distributed ledger systems 800 years ago.

They created bills of exchange: a Florentine merchant could deposit money in Florence and withdraw it in London, based on reconciled records across multiple cities. Multiple ledgers, periodic reconciliation, reputation-based trust. Sound familiar?

The medieval system worked because bankers solved real problems—moving money across bandit-filled routes was dangerous. Their innovation served genuine needs.

Medieval bankers also learned that trust requires accountability, which is why they eventually welcomed regulation. Cryptocurrency advocates seem to be relearning this through spectacular collapses.

The difference: Medieval bankers created trusted networks to facilitate trade. Crypto often feels like technology seeking problems to solve—recreating banking but slower and without consumer protections."
